## Overview
Many of the Staff Management Systems on the market is not free of charge. This obstructs the use of such systems in small and medium enterprises (SMEs), as resources of these companies are relatively constraints. To solve this, a compact open-source staff management system is being devloped. It is free of charge, and it allows everyone to extend its features. The system is easy to use, any kind of company will manage to use it. 

## Features
The project is used to gather and manage the information about the employees of a company. 

### Searching for Employee(s)
The user can search for employee(s) by defining the search criteria. The criteria include the employee’s staff number, name, age, role, phone number, address, birthday, gender, HKID number, bank account, salary, full time or part time, leave, suspension, etc. Also, the user can search for all employees with a salary higher than or lower than user input.

### Manipulate the Information of Employee(s)
The user can edit the information of the existing workers. Records of employee can be deleted in case of he is getting fired.

New employee can be created. Self-defined attributes can also be added. 

or delete attributes. Thus, the user can add a new worker or fire him. 

### Import/Export the Information of Employee(s)
The programme could read the information of the users from text files. Also, the user could export the information of the specific workers for reference.
Due to the scheduled time is limited, the information is stored in an array rather than in a database.

## Why the project is useful
This project is useful because it could facilitate the managing work of human resources. Searching workers by different attributes such as ages, salary, roles could help to specify a certain group of workers which help to obtain information about the size of related workers about and evaluate some policy. Allow adding or deleting self-defined attributes could help to customize different workers, companies and industries. Allow adding and firing workers could help to update the worker size in the system. Exporting information of workers out could help to save the workers’ information for reference.

## How users can get started with the project
The user can first define the amount of the workers and input the indicators of them, such as name or ID, then the user fills in the default attributes of them. To further alter the details, the user could alter and manipulate the attributes of various worker respectively.

## Where users can get help with your project
A video of how to set up a file of a worker and an example of a finalised worker file will be provided in order to help the user to get used to the programme as soon as possible.
